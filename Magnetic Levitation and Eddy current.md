#Magnetic Levitation

## Eddy Current
Eddy currents are induced current in shape of loop within conductors due to changing magnetic fields(Faraday's Law).

The current flows in perpendicular to magnetic field and magnitude of the current depends on some variable.
   1. *The strength of magnetic field.(Proportional)*
   2. *The area of loop.(Proportional)*
   3. *The rate of change flux.(Proportional)*
   4. *The resistivity of the material(Inversely Proportional)*


Eddy current creates a magnetic field opposed. (Lenz's Law)

Eddy current is usually unwanted at transformer, inductor and electric motors because of losses. Also, there are some conservation method. (if you are interested in, search the 'Lamination'.)
